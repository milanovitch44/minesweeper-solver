# minesweeper-solver

In my free time, I developed an algorithm for solving minesweeper puzzles. The algorithm works by generating sets of tiles that should collectively contain a certain number of mines. It then iteratively subtracts sets from each other until it finds a set that either contains only mines or contains no mines at all.
